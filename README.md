# GUI
This is a suite of files for a graphical user interface that navigates and selects from a gallery of images for the purposes of illustration reference and practice. Originally implemented in Tkinter and SQLite, the project is now coded in PyQt5 and MySQL.\
Consists of three applications:
### Manage Database
Consists of a lefthand gallery of images and a righthand display for selected image. Allows deletion and updating of records, as well as a slideshow function that can display images and videos in fullscreen.
### Gesture Draw
App for easy gesture drawing (drawing the pose of a figure in a short amount of time). Allows user to select images and specify the amount of time for each gesture draw.
### Machine Learning
A mostly experimental app for GUI-ifying the machine learning process, a la PerceptiLabs.
# Machine Learning
An exploratory dive into machine learning using Tensorflow and PyTorch. Due to memory constraints, most of the important files (models, datasets, etc.) are not stored on GitHub.
# Music
A suite if musuc related files primarily written for iPhone's Pythonista app, including an app for practicing scale degrees of musical keys and producing random melodies. Has been abandoned for the time being.
# School
